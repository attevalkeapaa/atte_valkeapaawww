    <h1>Production</h1>
    <p>The World Gold Council states that as of the end of 2017, "there were 187,200 tonnes of stocks in existence above ground". 
        This can be represented by a cube with an edge length of about 21 meters. 
        At $1,349 per troy ounce, 187,200 metric tonnes of gold would have a value of $8.9 trillion. 
        According to the United States Geological Survey in 2016, about 5,726,000,000 troy ounces (178,100 t) 
         of gold has been produced since the beginning of civilization, of which 85% remains in use.

        In 2017, the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes. 
        The second-largest producer, Australia, mined 300 tonnes in the same year, followed by Russia with 255 tonnes.
